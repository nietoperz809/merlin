    <b>BLACKJACK 13</b><br><br>

    In this game, buttons 1 through 10 represent a<br>
    deck of 10 cards.<br>

    OBJECT:<br>
    <br>
    To acquire the higher hand of 13 or less.<br>

    PREPARATION:<br>
    <br>
    Press NEW GAME. Then press #4.<br>

    PLAYING:<br><br>

    1. MERLIN is the dealer. Both of you start the<br>
    game with a hand of one card. The blinking<br>

    light shows your hand; the steady light shows<br>

    MERLIN'S hand. You (not MERLIN) also start the<br>
    game with a stake of five chips.<br>
 
    2. On your turn you may either "hit" your hand or<br>
     "stand."<br>
    a) If you want to "hit" your hand -to ask for<br>
    another card - press HIT ME.<br>
 
    If your hand then totals less than 13, you may<br>
    again either "hit" or "stand."<br>
    If your hand totals more than 13, you "bust"<br>
    and immediately lose.<br>
    b) If you want to "stand"- to take no more<br>
    cards - press COMPUTER TURN.<br>

    3. MERLIN then plays his hand according to the<br>
    following strategy:<br>

    a) If his hand is less than 10, he hits. If he<br>
    "busts," you win.<br>

    b) If his hand is 10 or more, he stands. When he<br>

    stands, MERLIN then compares his hand with<br>

    yours in order to determine a winner. At no<br>

    other time can MERLIN see your hand.<br>

    WINNING:<br>

    The winner is the player with the higher hand of<br>

    13 or less. Along with the WIN, LOSE or TIE sound,<br>

    MERLIN will also show each card that was<br>

    drawn in the hand.<br>

    CONTINUING:<br>

    This game consists of multiple hands. To play<br>

    another hand, press SAME GAME and watch the<br>

    numbered buttons closely. MERLIN will very<br>

    briefly light one number to show you how many<br>

    chips you have. (You receive one chip for each<br>

    hand that you win; you lose one chip for each<br>

    hand that MERLIN wins.) Then, to start the next<br>

    hand, MERLIN will deal each of you one card.<br>

    If you accumulate ten chips, you break the bank<br>

    and win the game. If you lose all of your chips,<br>

    you go broke and MERLIN ends the game. To<br>

    start a new game, press NEW GAME, then press<br>

    #4. You'll start again with 5 chips.<br>
