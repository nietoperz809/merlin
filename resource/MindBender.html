MINDBENDER<br>
<br>
OBJECT:<br>
<br>
To discover the mystery number in MERLIN'S<br>
computer brain.<br>
<br>
PREPARATION:<br>
<br>
Press NEW GAME. Then press #6. The and 10<br>
lights will blink. This is MERLIN'S way of asking you<br>
to select the length of his mystery number. To do<br>
this, press one button from 1 to 9. The higher the<br>
number you press, the longer and more difficult<br>
the mystery number will be. (For your first game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
we recommend that you press #2 -a 2-digit<br>
mystery number.)<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Let's say that you press #4. In secret,<br>
MERLIN will then select a random, 4-digit num-<br>
ber. Through a process of deduction, you try to<br>
discover all four digits in the correct order.<br>
<br>
To keep track of your guesses, use a pencil and<br>
a piece of paper.<br>
<br>
PLAYING:<br>
<br>
1. Try to discover the mystery number by entering<br>
guesses that correspond to the length of the<br>
number. EXAMPLE: If the mystery number has four<br>
digits, enter each guess by pressing any four<br>
buttons from 1 to 9 in any order that you prefer.<br>
You might want to guess 2-3-8-2, or 1-6-9-5, or<br>
4-4-4-4, etc.<br>
<br>
2. MERLIN will then let you know how accurately<br>
you guessed:<br>
<br>
a) If you guessed the correct digits in the<br>
correct order, MERLIN will make the WIN<br>
sound and will flash a light for each digit in<br>
the number.<br>
<br>
b) if any part of your guess was incorrect,<br>
MERLIN will make the LOSE sound and will<br>
show you how close your guess was:<br>
<br>
If none of the digits in your guess is a part of<br>
his number, MERLIN will blink the #10 light.<br>
<br>
For each correct digit that is also in the cor-<br>
rect order, MERLIN will show a blinking light.<br>
<br>
For each correct digit that is not in the cor-<br>
rect order, MERLIN will show a steady light.<br>
<br>
The blinking and steady lights will start<br>
at #1 and will not necessarily corre-<br>
spond either to the digits that you've<br>
guessed or to MERLIN'S mystery<br>
number.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Let's say that you ask MERLIN to select<br>
a 4-digit mystery number. In secret, MERLIN<br>
selects the number 9-2-4-2.<br>
<br>
a) If one of your guesses is 1-3-5-7, MERLIN will<br>
blink the #10 light. This light tells you that none<br>
of the digits in your guess was correct.<br>
<br>
b) If one of your guesses is 1-2-3-4, MERLIN will<br>
show a blinking light at #1 and a steady light<br>
at #2. These lights tell you that two of the<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
digits in your guess were correct and that one<br>
of them was in the correct order. Now it's up<br>
to you to determine which two digits you<br>
guessed correctly and which one of them<br>
was in the correct order,<br>
c) If one of your guesses is 4-2-2-9, MERLIN will<br>
show a blinking light at #1 and steady lights<br>
at #s 2, 3 and 4. These lights tell you that all of<br>
the digits in your guess were correct and that<br>
one of them was in the correct order.<br>
<br>
If you entered this guess right after the previous<br>
guess (1-2-3-4), you'd gain some important clues<br>
about the mystery number. First, you'd see that<br>
"2" is the only digit that appears in both guesses<br>
in the same order. You'd know, therefore, that the<br>
blinking light represents this digit. You'd also see<br>
that the "4" is the only other digit that appears in<br>
both guesses: fourth position in one guess, first in<br>
the other. You'd know therefore, that the "4" must<br>
fall in either the second or third position of the<br>
4-digit mystery number.<br>
<br>
d) If you guess 9-2-4-2, MERLIN will show blinking<br>
lights at #s 1, 2, 3 and 4 and will also make the<br>
WIN sound.<br>
<br>
SCORING:<br>
<br>
After you win, press SAME GAME. MERLIN will<br>
briefly shine a light showing the number of<br>
guesses you took. Remember, however, MERLIN<br>
can score only up to 10 guesses.<br>
<br>
COMPETING AGAINST<br>
ANOTHER PERSON:<br>
<br>
On your turn keep the buttons hidden from view.<br>
After discovering the mystery number and learn-<br>
ing your score, hand MERLIN to your opponent.<br>
Your opponent presses SAME GAME and also<br>
tries to determine the mystery number. The win-<br>
ner is the one to learn the mystery number in the<br>
fewer guesses.
