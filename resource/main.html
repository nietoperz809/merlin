    MERLIN<br>
    The Electronic Wizard<br>
    from Parker Brothers<br>
    For 1 or 2 Players<br>
    Ages 7-Adult<br>
    <br>
    MERLINâ„¢ is a remarkably intelligent computer. <br>
    Through light and sound he plays six different <br>
    games of chance, strategy, memory, logic and <br>
    skill. You can even teach him to play music! <br>
    <br>
    As you compete with him, you'll discover that <br>
    MERLIN is very talkative. He speaks with a unique <br>
    vocabulary of 20 electronic sounds. With these <br>
    sounds he challenges you to a game, responds <br>
    to your moves, and tells you when you've won, <br>
    lost or tied. It won't take you long at all to <br>
    become familiar with each of MERLIN'S sounds. <br>
    <br>
    Lights are part of the action, too! As you play, <br>
    you'll see that MERLIN uses lights to keep track of <br>
    your moves, to show you your score, and to <br>
    remind you, when you've finished playing, that <br>
    you haven't yet turned him off. <br>
    <br>
    Are you ready to match wits with MERLIN? Here <br>
    are the games he plays : <br>
    <br>
    1. Tic-Tac-Toe. MERLIN'S aggressive tactics will <br>
    keep you on your toes in this famous strategy <br>
    game. <br>
    <br>
    2. Music Machine. Teach MERLIN to play a tune <br>
    of up to 48 notes and rests. <br>
    <br>
    3. Echo. Repeat a tune of random notes that <br>
    MERLIN teaches you. <br>
    <br>
    4. Blackjack 13. MERLIN is the dealer in this com- <br>
    puterized version of the classic card game. <br>
    <br>
    5. Magic Square. Try to form a square of 8 lights. <br>
    This electronic puzzle changes constantly as you <br>
    play. <br>
    <br>
    6. Mindbender. Discover the computer's mystery <br>
    number. This game of logic is the ultimate chal- <br>
    lenge-to win you'll have to read MERLIN'S mind! <br>
