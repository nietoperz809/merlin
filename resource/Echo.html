    <b>ECHO</b><br>
    <br>
    OBJECT:<br>
    <br>
    To repeat a tune of random notes that MERLIN<br>
    plays to you.<br>
    <br>
    PREPARATION:<br>
    <br>
    Press NEW GAME. Then press #3. Both the and<br>
    10 lights will blink. This is MERLIN'S way of asking<br>
    you to select the number of notes in his tune. To<br>
    do this, press one button from 1 to 9. The higher<br>
    the number you select, the longer and more dif-<br>
    ficult the tune will be. Then press COMPUTER<br>
    TURN and MERLIN will play you the tune.<br>
    <br>
    EXAMPLE: To select a game of average diffi-<br>
    culty, press #5. Then press COMPUTER TURN and<br>
    MERLIN will play you a 5-note tune. To win, you<br>
    must repeat MERLIN'S tune exactly as he played<br>
    it.<br>
    <br>
    PLAYING:<br>
    <br>
    1. As MERLIN plays his tune, listen carefully to<br>
    the notes and watch closely the lights that<br>
    accompany them.<br>
    <br>
    2. When MERLIN stops playing, try to repeat the<br>
    exact order of notes and accompanying lights<br>
    by pressing the appropriate buttons.<br>
    <br>
    a) If you press a button in the correct order, it<br>
    will light and sound its note.<br>
    <br>
    b) If you press a button out of order, you'll hear<br>
    a buzz. Even if MERLIN buzzes you, continue<br>
    guessing - starting with the next note - until<br>
    you've pressed the appropriate number of<br>
    buttons.<br>
    <br>
    SCORING:<br>
    <br>
    a) If all of your notes are in the correct order,<br>
    MERLIN will make the WIN sound.<br>
    <br>
    b) Otherwise MERLIN will make the LOSE<br>
    sound and will show you -by lighting one<br>
    numbered button - how many errors you've<br>
    made.<br>
    <br>
    CONTINUING:<br>
    <br>
    To play the same tune again, press COMPUTER<br>
    TURN. To try a different tune - even one of equal<br>
    difficulty -press SAME GAME, press the desired<br>
    level of difficulty, then press COMPUTER TURN.<br>
    <br>
    COMPETING AGAINST<br>
    ANOTHER PERSON:<br>
    <br>
    On your turn, keep the buttons hidden from view.<br>
    When you've finished guessing and have seen<br>
    your score, hand MERUN to your opponent. Your<br>
    opponent presses COMPUTER TURN and tries to<br>
    repeat the very same tune. The winner is the one<br>
    to repeat MERLIN'S tune with the fewer errors.<br>
