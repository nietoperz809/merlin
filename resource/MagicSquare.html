    <b>MAGIC SQUARE</b><br>
<br>
<br>
    OBJECT:<br>
<br>
    To form a square of eight lights by lighting but-<br>
    tons 1,2,3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9. At the same time, you<br>
    will have to turn off button #5-the middle<br>
    button.<br>
<br>
<br>
    PREPARATION:<br>
<br>
    Press NEW GAME. Then press #5 and watch the<br>
    numbered buttons closely. MERLIN will very<br>
    briefly show you the Magic Square. Then you'll<br>
    see a random display of one or more blinking<br>
    lights.*<br>
<br>
    PLAYING:<br>
<br>
    Press buttons 1-9, in any order, until you've<br>
    formed the Magic Square. When you succeed,<br>
    MERLIN will flash the Magic Square and will<br>
    make the WIN sound.<br>
<br>
    MERLIN'S Secret Code<br>
<br>
    As you play Magic Square, you'll see that the<br>
    nine numbered buttons affect each others'<br>
    lights in certain predictable patterns. Each time<br>
    you press one of the buttons, certain lights<br>
    always come on and other lights always go off.<br>
    To form the Magic Square, you'll find it helpful to<br>
    understand these patterns- MERLIN'S secret<br>
    code.<br>
<br>
    EXAMPLE: Button #1 always affects lights 1, 2, 4<br>
    and 5 in a predictable pattern. That is, when<br>
    you press button #1, it reverses these lights: the<br>
    ones that were off will go on and the ones that<br>
    were on will go off. In this same way each of the<br>
    other numbered buttons reverses other groups<br>
    of lights. After you've played a few times you'll<br>
    discover which buttons reverse which groups of<br>
    lights.<br>
<br>
<br>
    CONTINUING:<br>
<br>
    To play Magic Square again, press SAME GAME<br>
    and start pressing buttons 1-9.<br>
<br>
    CHALLENGING ANOTHER PERSON -<br>
    FOR EXPERTS ONLY<br>
<br>
    On your turn, keep the buttons hidden from view.<br>
    After completing the Magic Square, take it<br>
    apart by secretly pressing up to three different<br>
    buttons from 1 to 9. Tell your opponent how many<br>
    buttons you just pressed. Then challenge your<br>
    opponent to recreate the Magic Square by<br>
    pressing the same number of buttons. To suc-<br>
    ceed, your opponent will have to press, in any<br>
    order, the same buttons that you pressed.<br>
<br>
    EXAMPLE: After completing the Magic Square,<br>
    take it apart by secretly pressing buttons 4, 9<br>
    and 2. Then challenge your opponent to try to<br>
    recreate the Magic Square by pressing only<br>
    three buttons. To succeed, your opponent will<br>
    have to press buttons 4, 9 and 2 in any order.<br>
<br>
    When your opponent recreates the Magic<br>
    Square, the two of you then reverse roles. In other<br>
    words, your opponent secretly presses any three<br>
    different buttons and challenges you in the<br>
    same way. The winner is the one to meet the<br>
    challenge. If each of you requires more than<br>
    three guesses, the winner is the one to recreate<br>
    the Magic Square in the fewer tries.<br>
<br>
    *At this point, or at other times during the game,<br>
    buttons 1-9 may all go dark. If this happens,<br>
    button #10 will blink, indicating that the game<br>
    is still on.<br>
