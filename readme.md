Merlin for Java
-
Currently games 1 to 5 are implemented. 
You need to have JRE >= 8 installed. 
Then simply invoke the jar file and Merlin appears 
as we would live in the good old 1970s. 
To start the game click "New Game" and then 3, 5, 2, 4 or 1. 
The other games are coming soon.

Right click in the Merlin window also shows the user guide.
